# Visualizing How Neural Networks Classify 2D Data

## About the project
The project intends to visualize how inputs are transformed linearly and non-linearly by a deep neural network. Users can interactively change 
the number of layers and neurons of the neural nets and their parameters.

This project is created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
and is now available at https://baichuanzhou.github.io/Intuitive-Classification/.

## Deployment

First use `git clone https://github.com/baichuanzhou/Intuitive-Classification` \
Then, `cd` to your directory and run: 

### `npm install`
Installs the necessary dependency for the App.

Then you can start the App in **development** mode:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!\
Then run:
#### `serve -s`
The app will run live at your local host http://localhost:3000
